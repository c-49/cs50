## Running the Projects

Each week's folder contains its own set of projects and requirements:
- Week 0: Projects can be viewed on Scratch website
- Week 1-5: C programs require a C compiler
- Week 6: Python scripts require Python 3
- Week 7: SQL projects require a database management system
- Week 8: Web projects can be viewed in any modern browser
- Week 9: Flask projects require Python and Flask installation

## Course Completion
